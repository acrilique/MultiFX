## Description

This has the intention to be a nice gadget for me when im djing with turntables and my 4 channel mixer. Providing a set of effects for the daisy pod, not having dry/wet controls as these are return effects and the mixer will take care of how much signal is getting back into the master. 

Reverb is now "dry/wet free" so next steps will be adding beat detection and another delay effect that isn't time-free but related to the current song tempo being 1/4 of it, 1/2, and so on.
